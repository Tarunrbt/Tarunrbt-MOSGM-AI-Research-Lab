## GROK HOSTILE REVIEW – ai-council/grok_001_adversarial_review.md

### 1. Single Most Fatal Flaw
The manuscript admits 72% degeneracy with MOND under current data but still markets itself as a "mechanistic why" behind MOND's "what"—this is intellectual sleight-of-hand. No single observable prediction distinguishes the "mechanism" from the phenomenology it claims to explain.

### 2. Most Damning Over-Claim or Under-Admission
The repeated phrase "MOSGM provides a mechanistic basis for MOND's acceleration scale" is the killer over-claim. The model admits full algebraic collapse in smooth regimes and only claims uniqueness in a resolution-bounded 28% "Goldilocks Zone" that no current telescope can probe. This is not a mechanism—it's a promissory note payable in 2030s data.

### 3. Predicted Reviewer Comment (Copy-Paste Style)
"Reviewer #2: The authors concede 72% degeneracy with MOND and confine potential novelty to an observationally inaccessible regime. The proposed 'mechanism' adds no new predictions, no improved fits, and no resolution to MOND's known failures (Bullet Cluster, wide binaries). It is a re-description dressed as explanation. Recommendation: Reject."
